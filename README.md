# AoC23
This is a test of the capabilities of GPT4. I start with telling ChatGPT I need assistance is solving the puzzle and then copy paste exactly from the Advent of Coding website.

Once GPT generates the python code, I copy paste it directly into Visual Code Studio and run it. I take the output and plug it into AoC. If it doesn't pass, I'll ask GPT to add debugging statements and attempt to fix itself with debug output.

At the end, I'll catalog my general impressions of ChatGPT as an assistant, and provide what insight I can as a non-dev.

Day 1: 
  P1: Success 1st try
  P2: Failed repeatedly - GPT is not great at complex regex

Day 2:
  P1: Success 1st try
  P2: Success 1st try

Day 3:
  P1: Failed repeatedly - debugging statement not helpful
  P2: No attempt

Day 4:
  P1: Success 1st try
  P2: Success 2nd try. 1st attempt was not optimized for large datasets and took so long I killed it

Day 5:
  P1: Success after 3 tries. This has been the first occurence of GPT successfullly fixing itself given its own debugging information
  P2: The first attempt ran my PC out of memeory (only 8gb on the device I'm using for this puzzle). After asking for optimization from GPT, second attempt also ran me out of memory. I may try again with a beefier system.
