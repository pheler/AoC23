# AoC23
This is a test of the capabilities of GPT4. I start with telling ChatGPT I need assistance is solving the puzzle and then copy paste exactly from the Advent of Coding website.

Once GPT generates the python code, I copy paste it directly into Visual Code Studio and run it. I take the output and plug it into AoC. If it doesn't pass, I'll ask GPT to add debugging statements and attempt to fix itself with debug output.

At the end, I'll catalog my general impressions of ChatGPT as an assistant, and provide what insight I can as a non-dev.

Day 1: 
  P1: Success 1st try
  P2: Failed repeatedly - GPT is not great at complex regex

Day 2:
  P1: Success 1st try
  P2: Success 1st try

Day 3:
  P1: Failed repeatedly - debugging statement not helpful
  P2: No attempt

Day 4:
  P1:
